                <p>Happier Than Ever is the second studio album by American singer and songwriter Billie Eilish, released on July 30, 2021, by Darkroom and Interscope Records. Eilish co-wrote the album with its producer, her brother Finneas O'Connell. She cited self-reflection during the COVID-19 pandemic as the biggest inspiration for the record.
Primarily a downtempo pop record, Happier Than Ever is characterized by subdued and sparse electropop arrangements set to slow tempos. It consists of torch songs about the downsides of stardom, drawing from Eilish's rise to fame. Music critics praised the album, underscoring its stylistic production and insightful lyrics. Five singles were released in promotion of the album: "My Future", "Therefore I Am", "Your Power", "Lost Cause", and "NDA", all of which charted in the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100. Happier Than Ever debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and topped the charts in 20 other countries. To promote the album further, a Disney+ documentary concert film, Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, will be released on September 3, 2021, and Eilish will embark on her fifth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever The World Tour, covering Europe and North America in 2022.</p>
